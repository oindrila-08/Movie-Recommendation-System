# Movie-Recommendation-System

A content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and machine learning techniques. This project analyzes movie metadata and recommends similar titles based on textual features such as genre, title etc.

Key Features
1. Personalized movie recommendations based on a selected title
2. Utilizes content-based filtering with TF-IDF and cosine similarity
3. Built using efficient data structures and scikit-learn tools
4. Scalable and easy to integrate into web applications (e.g., Streamlit)

Tech Stack

- **Languag**e: Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  

Future Enhancements
1. Integrate collaborative filtering for user-based recommendations
2. Improve NLP preprocessing using spaCy or NLTK
3. Deploy using Docker or cloud platforms (Render, Heroku, or AWS)
4. Enhance UI with front-end frameworks or Streamlit Components
